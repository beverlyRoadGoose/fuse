## Introduction
Fuse is a Go library for developing [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bots, using the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

{{< hint warning >}}
⚠️ I'm developing this for use in a hobby project, In the initial phase I'm only adding features as needed in the main
project. Overtime I'll aim to cover much of what the Telegram API provides. This also means some things might initially
be experimental and breaking changes are possible.
{{< /hint >}}

## Current Features
✔️ Register Webhooks  
✔️ Receive updates through Webhooks  
✔️ Receive updates through polling  
✔️ Send Messages  
✔️ Supports Local Bot API Servers
